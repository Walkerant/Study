# iOS
about iOS projects where at work,I sum up some experiences for others and me to use in future.

-scanDemo 
ScanDemo is a ios scaner for qrcode and barcode.If you want use ,you only import the header file 'WRScanView.h' in your projectto init the WRScanView where you can edit some property for your own style,such as tintColr,scanRect size,and so on,and implement some methods in the ViewController.m file as me.
